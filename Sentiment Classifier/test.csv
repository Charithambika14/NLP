r1-0063013,I've done this many times at different resorts as I travel frequently.
r1-0041343,I called in advance and asked for mix of redbean walnut and potato almond cookies in each box.

r1-0018292,"When we entered, we were greeted by this younger lady who spoke English."
r1-0004267,There's a reason this place doesn't have one.
r1-0075874,I'll just supplement Sarah L.'s review with my own experience here.
r1-0017683,"To get to the actual hotel, you HAVE to go inside Planet Hollywood which has the The Miracle Mile Shops, restaurants and a casino(The Pleasure Pit)!"

r1-0083741,"Three of us sat down around 4:30pm, it was slow and quiet so great to be able to catch up.....a fourth person joined us a couple hours later and we all ordered drinks."
r1-0027077,"Though the restaurant is pretty sizable (it takes up the whole lower floor under the club), they break up the dining areas using wooden screens, creating a bunch of semiprivate mini dining rooms."
r2-0004249,plum cake is best
r2-0010299,"Yet it feels like1955, when I got the juicy, delicious burger from here."

r1-0070865,"May look kinda shady and closed from the outside, and it is in the middle of a complicated plaza."
r2-0016212,"I went to a doctor's office. They do their best to accommodate your schedule and lifestyle, staying open a little later than most dr offices and even open on Saturdays!"
r1-0004037,"Note to Hilton: promote people like Bev- if there are more people like her, I'll be inclined to come back and tip more."

r1-0091575,"I waited at the door until they opened, promptly and needed to open another account."
r1-0000363,"Because of the limited English, it may take a little longer to understand what they have on the carts, some of them do rattle off the dishes pretty quick."

r1-0030326,"I'm a big fan of chinese food and when I have my cravings, I usually have to settle for places that have limited vegetarian options and greasy stir fry that tastes suspiciously like it has duck sauce or oyster sauce."

r1-0093299,The location in Pompano Beach was amazing.
r1-0097714,"You are first served an amuse bouche - not sure what it was but I think it was some sort of bread pudding but MANNN, if they sold that on its' own, it would be a best seller!"

r1-0010923,"The first time we went there my girlfriend had to drag me in, just based on looks, I did not get a good vibe from the place."

r1-0026432,"They have wine, and lots of it."
r2-0015132,"During the day, they provided coffee and fruit free of charge."
r1-0096102,Those RATS WERE SO BIGGGGG!!!
r1-0037326,"I get that they are different and maybe shouldn't be compared against one another, but drinking the Stirred Thing, I just thought, ""I'd much rather just have an Old Fasioned."""

r1-0012279,Oh boy!
r2-0018992,You'll get less for money - and spend more of it too.

r2-0008151,The atmosphere was decent.
r1-0072218,What we really noticed is the price:  Our total bill was about $40; my meal INCLUDED coffee and juice.
r1-0090048,Here for business.

r1-0077350,you should order from the bar .
r1-0064528,And it's not tough like most prime rib I've eaten at.
r1-0093880,"The place had a lot of promise - nice atmosphere, I liked how the menus were presented."
r1-0003007,Umm....OK.
r1-0034100,And I am very picky when it comes to red velvet cake because it could easily be too much flour or too much chocolate added.

r1-0097453,"Came here because we bought a Groupon, excited about the location and the outdoor feel."

r1-0093685,We were drunk in Vegas.
r1-0058916,"Though he did look busy, the waiter definitely glanced at us and walked away anyways despite the fact we were eagerly awaiting service."

r2-0018095,The office was nice but it was nonetheless way too beautiful!

r1-0017935,Tried the spare rib's.
r1-0093442,First time ordering here.
r1-0053296,I spoke with Ms. Lala.

r1-0008167,She has Deisy take all my calls and has her do all her footwork.
r1-0011389,She showed up for the rehearsal and the day of the event.
r1-0002272,The only thing  is there is not a lot of seating so you might have a bit of trouble  finding a table during peak lunch or dinner hours.
r1-0006562,The night before my visit was an 1 1/2 hour wait.
r2-0002992,"The hair treatments work, and the price is fair."
r2-0007065,you have a passport so you should be able to get in
r1-0048396,"Not necessarily a family place, not the kind of place that has McDonald's written all over it, this is more of a diner rather than a restaurant."
r1-0066627,and if you hire him to clean your windows .
r1-0076401,And we know a ton of people in the industry around this area and we will be sharing our experience to them as well.

r1-0073574,On parle d'environ 200 places au total et il y a m√™me un 2√®me √©tage disponible pour les √©v√©nements sp√©ciaux.
r1-0027255,They give out only a certain amount of clues so use them only when you're really stuck.
r1-0013285,"If you like disappointment, don't come here."
r1-0038168,One criticism I would have is the delay in getting back to emails.
r1-0057437,The outside deck was pretty full so we went inside instead.
r1-0033764,I believe most of their products are locally sourced if not organically sourced.
r2-0010516,They were very skilled at succeeding in making us want to get out of there as fast as possible.
r1-0049188,I had become familiar with the managers and this day I think it was Chris who was working the bar.
r1-0090808,"I also tasted both of my friends' dishes (steak frites and halibut), both of which were the cat's pajamas as well."

r1-0033627,"Yeah, not true."
r1-0090020,"They gave me sooooo much more, and I'm just concerned that I didn't tip properly on the right amount."
r1-0012376,After he had collected all of his information he left the room and spa music came on and when he returned he dimmed the light and it felt perfect atmosphere.

r1-0101431,"Tonight I ordered through Urber Eats, long business day..."
r2-0013278,I felt like the nurses here couldn't care less about me. They killed my best friend.
r1-0048196,Then you see a little black door with a sign over it that says Restaurant.
r1-0072955,"But it ain't mine, so I come to Red Rock (I've probably been 15 times) for the only organic experience you can get within a 100-mile radius."
r2-0009239,I don't remember what the name was but it was interesting.
r1-0031009,I want to say it's the size of a palm of a hand.
r1-0097121,They asked if I would like to take him to their backyard area and play with him so I took him out there and let him off of his leash.
r1-0032427,I figured it was due to the amount of customers.

r1-0098122,"The second time I went was with a large group of people (~12), which given the size of the place, proved to be a bit of a chore."
r1-0062028,"We had the following: Foie Gras, Tuna Adobo, Shrimp Capellini, sides of Au gratin potatoes and grilled asparagus."
r1-0064427,Short on time?
r1-0050891,The first contract was exactly the deal we laid out.
r1-0083014,This shows in the contract as down payment money which is true because I verified how the dealership got the numbers.
r2-0006256,The noodles were so tasty.
r1-0010405,The last thing that I wanted to do was go to some shady pawn shop and hope for the best.
r1-0071555,My wife and I tried Boca Loca a couple weeks ago for the first time and that experience was absolutely amazing.
r1-0045144,Even better is the fact that the head is made up of bunches of little platters.
r1-0014951,"As an added bonus, merchandise was exactly where it was supposed to be, even with the right price tags!"
r1-0006629,I have driven through here many times and ordered filled donut holes.
r1-0092105,"They use rice flour, tofu and other soy based products, but I doubt you'd be able to tell you weren't eating chicken!!"
r2-0004457,"I came here when in Vegas with my friends, since my friend said I'd love it."

r1-0008402,I returned to work and searched the repair and the average was around $1000.
r1-0066793,They took it back and the manager brought the hot food back out and personally apologized.
r1-0086502,"They will just rush you out the door, skip washing or wetting your hair and five minutes later you will be done."
r1-0028080,There's a second half bath as well (sink and toilet).
r1-0058018,My fianc√© and I came to try it but didn't feel up to a sit down meal.
r1-0084286,"Very affordable!.....that being said, we get to the room and lay down immediately."
r1-0055008,Cook there food for longer as well instead of everything being cold/frozen in the middle.
r1-0015325,I had seafood tacos and the others had the steak and enchilada.
r1-0020414,"I went there to buy a dove stamp for my hunting license for the opening day of the season and my god, I couldn't have made a worse choice coming here."

r2-0000235,They take more hour it was so irritating
r1-0056656,"I had been to the Aveda academy in Toronto, which is apparently known as one of the better academies."
r1-0040287,"I tried 5 Guys for the first time today, and as a burger connoisseur I was excited."
r1-0005182,It's a Friday so I understand must be busy.
r1-0004685,Came here for a late night snack.
r2-0012492,The service quality is even unbelievable.
r1-0039368,Went here last night looking for some good asian food.

r1-0063257,For dessert for had the Blacout Cake which was too die for.
r1-0015109,"My husband & I would come at least every other month, if not once a month for the past 2 years."

r2-0010044,The Finance guy was a big crook.
r1-0019468,New Years Day 2014.

r1-0054214,I can't list all their wares... too many.
r1-0098453,Tell them to send Steve.
r1-0059056,When greeted I had a New girl that had JUST graduated cosmetology school and was brand new at shop.
r1-0086791,This is not a SPA.
r1-0098971,Ahhhh this place... Can you guys add more staff please?
r1-0018008,All pizzas are 1 size which I would measure to be XXL.
r1-0096899,Granted I was only on there for 1 sec .
r1-0051315,So I wanted to confirm this and I was told it's true.
r2-0015114,The food options and slim.
r1-0100169,[we tipped very well that night] The guy making our food brought us our food and engaged us in a friendly chat for about 15 minutes [much needed to restore his nerves].
r1-0054700,We had diner with eight friends on New Year's eve.
r1-0099864,When I used him in the past his attitude was very nonchalant but I thought who couldn't service a unit right?

r1-0019341,"Only when we couldn't possible eat another bite, dinner came to a close."

r1-0030093,"Some FYI's before the review begins:

1."
r1-0050956,I arrived on time for my departure from LV to LA and had purchased my ticket about a month ahead of time.
r2-0001753,"My entree was a filet mignon that I asked to be fried medium rare, and WOW did a great job."
r2-0019721,"This is supposed to be 50% ground beef which contains 30% fat, and 50% bacon."
r2-0015277,We had to wait a significant amount of time for a table and then we decided the waiting time was worth it.
r1-0092282,I've actually suggested that the Best at this location ask more people who've had great experiences to review on yelp.
r1-0056416,The airport's PA announcers play the part too.
r2-0011806,The clerks enjoyed cracking jokes with each other while we waited for service.
r1-0083856,"This is the first time I've had a cleaning lady as an adult, and it certainly won't be the last time."

r1-0044896,I am now waiting for my card and will update this review when I receive my AZ card.
r1-0074837,I needed something very important for the following day at work.

r1-0080471,I just wanted to get an idea of wait time for a party of two.
r1-0087507,"Most of these insurance scams give you a taste back, a dinner or even cash back."
r1-0046043,Wanted to try this place for the first time.
r2-0019098,A fine-dining establishment in name only.
r1-0016271,"But seriously, save your shower for here."
r1-0020321,(after all there are no dive bars anywhere near me/in Gilbert)
r1-0034885,Got there around four.
r1-0101442,Funny thing.
r1-0095059,"One night, I went down to gamble."
r1-0045693,I ordered a cupcake that is the vegan equivalent of a chocolate hostess cupcake.

r2-0008828,I'll definitely be back to try more great entrees! awesome
r1-0022458,Called at 2:00 to make sure they delivered to our address and the person who answered said yes.
r1-0077181,(I explained how I wanted the crab salad - just two ingredients) I got spicy crab that they stuff inside sushi and a whole bunch of cucumber sticks.
r1-0065143,She was not at all tenative about dining with the 3.
r1-0016812,I would have liked some time in between each course.
r1-0016061,I ordered some delivery food yesterday.
r1-0075893,I did get a ginger cookie for later and it was small which wouldn't matter if it was good but for me it didn't have a strong enough ginger taste.
r2-0006286,The bad reviews of service are reflected by my experiences.
r1-0004911,No brainer to come back if we're in the general area again!
r2-0000947,We were happy the place wasn't crowded.
r1-0042998,"No more comments, gotta keep it nice......"
r2-0000959,This is definitely one of the most friendly post offices I've ever been to...
r1-0041901,They get tipped regardless.

r1-0053469,"I am a blackjack player, but I by no means have the bankroll to play the higher minimum tables (15-25$) found at most other blackjack tables on the strip."
r1-0088705,The menu implies it but more explicit info may help with disappointment  again I had none.
r1-0017310,That's exactly what the gentleman behind the counter last night on Christmas Day did as we walked in.
r1-0034553,It has an old Italian restaurant feel.
r1-0061007,I needed a courier service in Phoenix at 6:30 pm so I frantically called all the courier and delivery services I could find on google and yelp; only to be told that no they are not available for any deliveries.. Great so I continued searching and found Reliable Couriers.
r1-0066143,Pleasant decor though.
r1-0019722,"It is pretty hard to screw up a cheeseburger, but they succeeded in this also."
r1-0075664,Dec. 13th.
r1-0061780,And the nitro iced affogato!!
r1-0048648,Je passais souvent devant le commerce sans oser y aller.

r2-0014047,Once upon a time the model made a good nice super decision.
r1-0082716,"Shrimp
4."
r2-0013286,Awesome penthouse suite.
r1-0032265,And don't even get me started on the cheesecake!
r2-0012991,Bottomless chips with decent salsa. It was disgusting.
r1-0072571,The one single.
r1-0098592,"My first trip I had the bacon carmel toffee, this was sweet meets slightly salty, not an overwhelming bacon flavor."
r1-0061086,Nothing but positive feed about this location.
r2-0000492,it was very great
r1-0060891,"The room is spacious, and looks decent at first glance."
r1-0042348,Split one plate!
r1-0051581,"Malheureusement, ce n'√©tait pas encore le cas de l'assiette de fromages quand j'y suis all√©."
r1-0033246,"i protected it like a newborn on my flight back to clevo from the west coast, and felt very strongly about getting my newborn dressed all pretty to hang on my wall."
r2-0009073,You should go here for happy hour
r1-0084845,I had an appointment at 4:30p.
r1-0045316,They gave us a fob for another car!
r1-0052869,We placed an order for an event and were going to have to pick up the day before.
r1-0076788,Hers was the best  meal of the three.
r1-0060135,Get the burnt ends if they haven't sold out.
r1-0025283,I instantly needed a dirty martini (extra olives please!)
r1-0038566,Received telephone call from Robert (plumber) who indicated that he was at the site.
r1-0035616,But we have all dealt with people anxious to get in and get out and collect their money.
r1-0098873,The dessert is nothing to write home about.
r2-0010340,"Okay, I'm not a pharmacist, so I asked if he could elaborate and he states ""One you can make meth with and the other you can't."" And I was hooked.  Best day of my life."
r1-0045115,"I'm gluten free and my husband is vegan, so not the easiest feat to find something special for our wedding."
r1-0016446,My credit and financial standing isn't the best.
r2-0005808,I would definitely recommend making reservations. We love recommendations.
r1-0001985,That's all I have to say.
r1-0054905,Luckily!
r1-0053496,It's about $7 to get in and that covers the two days.
r1-0017293,Did not charge me anything!!
r1-0084847,One of the problems with fusion foods is that they tend to be one dimensional.
r2-0018163,You have a very small knowledge of this in your daily life.
r1-0067132,The place is pretty small so it got very crowded quickly.
r1-0082052,We did however go back on Saturday July 2nd.
r1-0030820,Two adults and 2 children.
r1-0085616,Holy smokes!
r1-0093012,I told her the crab had a bit of a smell and she looked so sad and embarrassed to have served me the crab even though it clearly wasn't her fault.
r1-0011261,We should have gotten two for the four of us and they let us each order our own.I felt so bad wasting so much amazing seafood.
r1-0015217,They have a permanent coupon on their website for buy an entree get a second 1/2 off.
r1-0094645,The bar n activities were fun.
r1-0090102,There was something about the coffee rub that is going to compell me to go through hsi cookbooks in hopes I find what exactly is in it.
r1-0031691,Our margaritas were extremely strong with an over abundance of tequila to the point that it was all that you tasted.
r1-0057569,"First off, I like a dive place as much as the next person."
r1-0049780,And who gives you extra mac salad?
r1-0012375,"It was already getting late so we decided to sit at the bar, play poker and listen to dueling piano."
r1-0073935,When one of them got stung by a scorpion the office visit to the vet set relations way back.
r1-0052063,"This is a mom and pop store, check them out if you are in the area."
r1-0026427,This place is fair dinkum
r1-0045562,"I came here for one reason, the free Sunday paper."
r1-0069057,Smelled incredibly good in there though.
r2-0005136,The Shombo wrap was saucy deliciousness and the seating was plain.
r1-0045941,I just had that feeling like a total makeover.
r1-0061580,This sounds healthy right?
r1-0078768,Which we understand if you can't do something but he offered no explanation or help whatsoever.
r1-0052817,"We settled on the Hi Gloss, I handed him my keys and left for a few hours."
r1-0019208,Tried to have my car repaired.
r1-0088263,"Thanks, and those that don't drink thank you also."
r1-0091172,Since I have never had alcohol to my lips it did not interest me.
r2-0015798,The menu options are very small.
r1-0060980,I rent a lot of cars...
r1-0073537,"I literally take a 2 minite walk to LA Fitness, so many stores and restaurants around this nice and very safe area."
r1-0033953,What sold me was when I was wandering around the store.
r1-0066276,He agreed.
r1-0012440,3 long hours passed.
r1-0057447,CASH ONLY!!
r1-0000736,Came here with several family members (party of 8).
r1-0033646,Perfect if you can't find a spot or it is raining out!!
r1-0008221,"It's kinda uncomfortable sitting at the bar to eat your food the way the bar is designed, so your food isn't in a great position for you to eat so you might wanna sit at a table instead."
r1-0053843,"I went in to buy a gift for my mom for her birthday and the lady didn't have the item in the store, so she ordered it from another store and had it delivered as a gift to my mom's house."
r1-0036602,I just docked a star from my review of BRGR.
r1-0087206,It's what I expected and the delivery guy was polite.
r1-0079357,My family & I were going on a Sunday.
r1-0071175,"In fact , you owe him !"
r2-0019796,that is a meaning ful staff.
r1-0090054,Though a few nurses are very sweet.
r1-0096895,So i get there and head directly to the moshi stand.
r1-0055595,Loud enough atmosphere wise but not because they're blasting music out the speakers.
r1-0062831,If you love spicy and seafood then this is the location !!
r1-0083013,"Ordered Chicken Korma, Mutton Biryani  and naan."
r1-0038612,We had an unfortunate incident where we had to put our family dog to rest.
r1-0023187,Chose to have all windows and windshield done.
r2-0011670,We had a nice time dining in the casino we stayed at.
r1-0070102,"But I do believe that the meats used in this place are 'halal' meats, so I doubt this allows for fresh ground beef made into handmade patties."
r1-0071444,First and last trip.
r1-0016913,Service was GREAT!!!
r1-0094432,Order was to be ready at at 4pm.
r1-0093195,My husband and I arrived here at 1 pm on a Sunday.
r1-0031681,I went to Platinum Entourage in hopes that they could fix the horrific highlights and cut that Color salon at Cesar's palace had gave me.
r1-0083239,It looked like some of the South Tower rooms connected directly to the pool/jacuzzi area and have private patios.
r1-0086349,I ordered a takeout pizza in January of 2016.
r2-0013801,My buddy and I shared a late Friday night.
r1-0081710,Tip #1 -  this place is CASH ONLY.
r1-0069742,I just want to take all of them home.
r1-0012996,Two words : GAME OVER.
r1-0084514,I had no clue it was an issue with Eat24.
r1-0091494,One of me sucking the head of the biggest crawfish I've ever seen.
r1-0026013,"Finally, the seating is fun."
r1-0029845,"I visited on a Saturday evening, with a party of 4."
r1-0047669,"However, after the 30 minutes was up a new passenger was coming aboard and the driver has her take the open seat!"
r1-0026375,"My washing machine was not draining, flooding, and we smelled something burning when we opened the door."
r2-0001702,"We were hoping to go to the one in Brossard, but we just couldn't find it."
r1-0022819,She was most excited for the singing part!
r2-0012424,In my hour of so there 4 different tables walked out with happy faces despite the wait time.
r1-0032760,I would try different roll next time.
r1-0033610,Just saying.
r1-0046281,I ordered their version of a cold brew - they pour a certain amount in a cup and then cut it with water.
r1-0062575,My fianc√© and I arrived late last night.
r2-0000128,Fake celeb.
r1-0097257,"To boot, gratuity was automatically included at 15% so we couldn't leave a smaller tip."
r1-0031588,Temperature is in the 50's.
r1-0053767,We were offered the kitchen side table which we didn't know anything about.
r1-0039720,But after sitting down our food was out in 5 minutes!
r2-0017339,My orders have been consistent and what you'd expect from any other Chipotle. It was delicious.
r1-0100966,My boyfriend and I took the survey after a visit and were dissatisfied.
r1-0072081,Our water ran low and 2 seconds later we had a whole new ice cold jug set down on the table.
r1-0075990,He told what he would do and about how long he thought it would take.
r1-0062738,"""Legitimate"" sake bar."
r1-0080960,I forgot to mention in my last review of Disgraceland that the bathrooms are not accessible and the bathrooms are gendered.
r1-0060846,"bought some pants, called them up, wanted to know if they have same day service."
r1-0021261,And it is popping almost everyday.
r1-0012670,Let's start with the pasty that one of the diners had.
r2-0008276,"They don't add too much breading, which makes it more authentic. It is so good."
r1-0078418,You can even see them cleaning the wine glasses until there was not a single speck of anything other than glass.
r1-0057159,"Especially where some of those reviewers will say basically that the food was so-so, the service wasn't good and the place wasn't clean -- then they leave a 4-star rating??!!"
r1-0091181,"The last item was an apple, a Reece's Pieces Apple!"
r1-0066654,Our daughter just had a tooth pulled out and 3 cavity fillings done recently and require soft food so we brought a small bowl of home cooked porridge with chopped veggies in case she wasn't able to eat what they had at this restaurant.
r1-0097554,"Ice-T is much healthier than their choice of sodas so they can't possibly play the, ""it's healthier card."""
r1-0092660,Dropped into the 9:30 class here.
r1-0056072,The truth is I am not a fan of Korean BBQ and that sucks because all my friends are and so is my girlfriend.
r1-0060470,"It was a 2 week tour in L.A., Boston and New York City, so by the time I settled back in Scottsdale I was a mess."
r2-0016111,I don't know
r1-0006194,Love Dr.
r1-0061346,We have no experience sitting in the bar.
r1-0041690,-the pull out couch is terrible so dont make anyone sleep on it.
r1-0061662,Nice concept you don't have to eat what some corporate vp decided was good.
r1-0076101,Imho they should have at least 7 or 8 but that's just my two cents.
r1-0057222,"If you are ok not paying for the over styled,  pretentious."
r2-0015131,This Georgian place is often busy and thus a reservation is recommended.
r1-0012643,Someone PLEASE bring this idea to the states.
r2-0015990,I have been with SmartGym for almost two years. The time flew by
r1-0067942,Selection is endless.
r2-0013314,I might come back and try a old item though.
r1-0067697,You have to have patience.
r1-0028275,The pictures online give the impression of an upscale sushi place.
r1-0087547,"Other than that minor hiccup, our water glasses were kept full, adult drinks brought to the table in a timely fashion, and plenty of meat, meat, meat."
r1-0004740,Are you Pho-king kidding me?!?
r1-0088417,"After this, you pay at the cashiers."
r1-0018057,"My brother and I went here for lunch, and we understood AYCE places would be busy and that is fine."
r1-0064503,Parking lot is full all the time.
r2-0005681,Also love the ATM deposit function! It rocks.
r1-0099537,"This frys has a water dispensing machine outside, redbox, and a Bank of America inside."
