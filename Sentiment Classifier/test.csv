r1-0003272,"Obviously the bigger your party the lower your bill will be, no matter how much more you order."
r1-0069342,I agree with the rest that the Mild  is about as spicy as I'd go.
r1-0034597,I told them what this other company had said was wrong then asked how much it would be if they had to replace the unit.
r1-0066954,"If I had to say something bad about the experience, which isn't even their fault, but I looked forward to an ice cold Dixie beer."
r1-0029868,"If you go to the menu on the website it lists everything as coming in Pt or Qt sizes, great that is how I love my Chinese."
r2-0013530,I doesn't make difference.
r1-0065378,"(my ignorance i suppose)

Anyhoo..."
r1-0072663,The dinning room was clean (or seemed so) & was well decorated for a Thai restaurant.
r2-0005063,I love to have best warm tasty chicken pot pies.
r1-0083428,I'm not sure what was going on that night but we have eaten here before and experience great service and delicious meals.
r1-0053151,"Okay, let me be more specific."
r1-0062468,Composed desserts on the menu are much better.
r1-0003326,I was astounded at all of the food on the floor in the kitchen in plain view of the patrons.
r1-0037547,I walked in thinking I'm going to love this no matter what.
r1-0060780,I reviewed my home warranty policy and those items up to $300 were included.
r1-0015849,I ordered to go two gyros with fries and the jalapeno hummus with pita bread.
r1-0012712,Thank you for putting your customers needs first.
r1-0052317,They got the oder out!
r1-0069635,"Keep in mind if this is your first time, your thumb will get sore quickly that it would be hard to push on gas at some point."
r2-0017999,It was not prepared and motivated to order.
r1-0018210,OK - we did not challenge the culinary capabilities of this restaurant.

r2-0012280,He is not an athlete.
r1-0043992,Visiting the Pittsburgh area for a quick weekend getaway for football.
r1-0028789,Today I asked if they carried TVP - I used to be able to find this on the top of the bulk aisles in clam shells.
r1-0073478,They have an attitude with everybody who walks in .
r1-0026748,By contrast there is a comparable home on our same street has been on the market for MONTHS.
r1-0058941,There were about 12 other people in the tour.
r1-0049121,It's hard to give a good gauge as well...I'm white and hardly ate spicy food before spending several months in Korea - the taste buds adapted.
r1-0027283,I always have to ask for more and more dressing and then I feel like I'm a hog.
r1-0043749,The room had our special requests I the room prior to our arrival.

r1-0011000,"Miss this bank, big time."
r1-0100025,The only downfall is on my end that I don't have more friends who like sushi as much as I do.
r1-0085673,Pick up order and eat on paper plates.
r1-0015884,With this im cool.
r1-0018847,It's not like she had an emergency that required her to stop working.

r1-0040911,"Mr A went with the $250 Market Menu, whereas I opted for the $168 one."
r1-0045041,Ask for Jennifer.
r1-0092427,I was ready with cash but the party in front of us paid with cards.
r1-0086189,I checked my food and found a Rock!!!
r1-0074513,The second guy I spoke to said it would be the same price and set up a time for the installer to put in the new box.
r1-0098281,"After spending the last week eating his leftovers, I've gone up 2 pants sizes, my vision has diminished and I can barely feel my feet."
r1-0005017,Many business people have avoided coming here in the past as its taken a little longer to order and deliver lunch than other near by places.
r1-0096348,One cocktail has homemade beef jerky.
r1-0050361,"We ate our salads like true basic bitches, although one of us was a guy, but men can be basic too."
r1-0034808,Recommended to leave room for dessert...
r2-0008334,"Zoes Kitchen could be my go-to healthy, quick, affordable restaurant choice"
r1-0083816,So I say again.
r2-0004107,"We had the spinach and artichoke dip, buffalo chicken sandwich and buffalo chicken wrap - all were good for topping off the trash."
r1-0000793,Never smiles.
r1-0005344,"A whole shop that does a sweet croissant, cut in half, and filled with whipped cream?"

r1-0074871,"Well, he went directly to his phone and started doing something, we couldn't tell what, but he utterly ignored the girl in front of him."
r1-0004138,They are fair.
r1-0049215,So sometimes it takes a long time to be seen.
r1-0051338,"As for desserts, their soynamis were pretty much a soy soft serve."
r1-0042825,1st time and last time!
r1-0091575,"I waited at the door until they opened, promptly and needed to open another account."
r1-0000363,"Because of the limited English, it may take a little longer to understand what they have on the carts, some of them do rattle off the dishes pretty quick."
r1-0068714,Maybe it was because the two of us ordered for eight people and it's some kind of quantity prize.
r2-0012858,"If there were no window repair salesmen, I would return. This place rocks."
r1-0052066,"Full disclosure: I lived in France for 6 years, so I'm always a bit skeptical of ""authentic"" French cuisine in the US."

r1-0075510,I was glad that I was't paying for foams and painstaking garnishes.
r1-0062703,To be honest I haven't tried any of their main dishes - so can't really comment on the general quality of the food.
r1-0030326,"I'm a big fan of chinese food and when I have my cravings, I usually have to settle for places that have limited vegetarian options and greasy stir fry that tastes suspiciously like it has duck sauce or oyster sauce."
r1-0038242,While waiting there's sprinkle cupcake across the way or kitson to shop at.
r1-0093299,The location in Pompano Beach was amazing.
r1-0097714,"You are first served an amuse bouche - not sure what it was but I think it was some sort of bread pudding but MANNN, if they sold that on its' own, it would be a best seller!"

r1-0056875,Very quickly  we wait only couple min !
r1-0094318,We can't find one thing even average about this place.
r1-0083133,The food trucks were almost exclusively carnie style.

r2-0018801,"Big fan of this establishment, too bad it closed."
r1-0042058,"I am going to be honest, Canada's beer, wine, liquor selection is dismal at best."
r1-0010923,"The first time we went there my girlfriend had to drag me in, just based on looks, I did not get a good vibe from the place."
r1-0087129,I guess it just depends on what location you would like to visit.
r1-0026432,"They have wine, and lots of it."
r2-0015132,"During the day, they provided coffee and fruit free of charge."
r1-0096102,Those RATS WERE SO BIGGGGG!!!
r1-0037326,"I get that they are different and maybe shouldn't be compared against one another, but drinking the Stirred Thing, I just thought, ""I'd much rather just have an Old Fasioned."""
r1-0064535,"I hate to say this, but I have gone elsewhere in an attempt to find something closer to Columbus, Ohio (where I currently live), but nothing compares."

r1-0019197,(If that's a thing).

r2-0012666,There are so much to choose from. i love it
r1-0012279,Oh boy!
r2-0018992,You'll get less for money - and spend more of it too.
r1-0003325,"Take the time, spend ten more cents and get what your dad would have bought and have it fixed for good."

r1-0064448,My only (small) complaint was that the soft serve was a bit icy.
r2-0008151,The atmosphere was decent.
r1-0072218,What we really noticed is the price:  Our total bill was about $40; my meal INCLUDED coffee and juice.
r1-0090048,Here for business.
r1-0026436,It took some time to get a pint of Cheetah dark beer (yum!
r1-0044233,"For a price tag of over $400 a person for the degustation, it takes a lot to not have any buyers remorse."
r1-0077350,you should order from the bar .
r1-0064528,And it's not tough like most prime rib I've eaten at.
r1-0093880,"The place had a lot of promise - nice atmosphere, I liked how the menus were presented."
r1-0003007,Umm....OK.
r1-0034100,And I am very picky when it comes to red velvet cake because it could easily be too much flour or too much chocolate added.
r1-0029415,Okay let me start out by saying that I am extremely picky about who watches my children as any concerned parent would be !

r1-0039557,The doctor worked fast and abrupt.
r1-0096735,Needless to say I was mindfreaked.
r1-0021281,Cycling is already expensive enough without being charged for every little thing.
r2-0010809,I typically like Church\'s nevertheless the chicken was dry and it just wasn\'t tantalizing.
r1-0098516,She issued me a refund with no problem.
r1-0096685,"After I joked that they need some seating, the receptionist casualty said the waiting are was in an adjacent room as if I was supposed to know."

but if you must ....
keep it a secret, between just you and me ;o)"

r2-0005191,Will definitely be returning. amazing service
r1-0016449,One of the things that stands out to me is that they stop to wash their hands before preparing your coffee.
r1-0038263,"Don't pop in to check it out,  just keep driving."
r1-0097453,"Came here because we bought a Groupon, excited about the location and the outdoor feel."
r1-0005178,Our food came out promptly.
r1-0023328,I can honestly say that this was the first salmon meal I ever ate at a restaurant that wasn't dry.

r1-0079409,Good bye Papa.

r1-0004792,The taro milk tea tasted like real taro.

r2-0016497,another five minutes after asking for our first refill The hummus and flatbread appetizer was still pretty good.
r1-0008245,"Small talk turned to ""What a  small world""."

r2-0015868,Best conversation around.
r1-0067037,"I mean, if the place is called ""Bread Company"" I expect the bread to be something special, you know what I mean?"
r1-0093685,We were drunk in Vegas.
r1-0058916,"Though he did look busy, the waiter definitely glanced at us and walked away anyways despite the fact we were eagerly awaiting service."
r1-0101211,Watch out for some of the tree roots that have bubbled up under the asphalt.
r2-0018706,"If you want to pay more, do not go to Egg Works!"
r1-0020819,Total WIne is like a hobby shop for alcoholics.
r2-0011194,The restaurant was good
r2-0018095,The office was nice but it was nonetheless way too beautiful!
r1-0064401,"Upon arriving, I was a little skeptical as the building looks like an old house and not ""spa-ish""."
r1-0017935,Tried the spare rib's.
r1-0093442,First time ordering here.
r1-0053296,I spoke with Ms. Lala.
r1-0053654,Very cheap meals.

r1-0095741,Will never use wal-mart again for prescriptions!!

r1-0065983,But he reassured me it will be fine as long as I give them my name.
r1-0076407,My pool pump went out just before New Year's and company coming into town.

r1-0049753,They close at 3am.
r1-0008167,She has Deisy take all my calls and has her do all her footwork.
r1-0011389,She showed up for the rehearsal and the day of the event.
r1-0002272,The only thing  is there is not a lot of seating so you might have a bit of trouble  finding a table during peak lunch or dinner hours.
r1-0006562,The night before my visit was an 1 1/2 hour wait.
r2-0002992,"The hair treatments work, and the price is fair."
r2-0007065,you have a passport so you should be able to get in
r1-0048396,"Not necessarily a family place, not the kind of place that has McDonald's written all over it, this is more of a diner rather than a restaurant."
r1-0066627,and if you hire him to clean your windows .
r1-0076401,And we know a ton of people in the industry around this area and we will be sharing our experience to them as well.
r2-0004699,We tried a new place. My husband and I stopped in after church and never had such terrible service in this restaurant.
r1-0073574,On parle d'environ 200 places au total et il y a même un 2ème étage disponible pour les événements spéciaux.
r1-0027255,They give out only a certain amount of clues so use them only when you're really stuck.
r1-0013285,"If you like disappointment, don't come here."
r1-0038168,One criticism I would have is the delay in getting back to emails.
r1-0057437,The outside deck was pretty full so we went inside instead.
r1-0033764,I believe most of their products are locally sourced if not organically sourced.
r2-0010516,They were very skilled at succeeding in making us want to get out of there as fast as possible.
r1-0049188,I had become familiar with the managers and this day I think it was Chris who was working the bar.
r1-0090808,"I also tasted both of my friends' dishes (steak frites and halibut), both of which were the cat's pajamas as well."

r1-0033627,"Yeah, not true."
r1-0090020,"They gave me sooooo much more, and I'm just concerned that I didn't tip properly on the right amount."
r1-0012376,After he had collected all of his information he left the room and spa music came on and when he returned he dimmed the light and it felt perfect atmosphere.
r1-0056435,"Finally ordered - Eggs Benedict Florentine for me, Pancakes & sausage for my niece, and a Bagel with Salmon for the BF."
r1-0101431,"Tonight I ordered through Urber Eats, long business day..."
r2-0013278,I felt like the nurses here couldn't care less about me. They killed my best friend.
r1-0048196,Then you see a little black door with a sign over it that says Restaurant.
r1-0072955,"But it ain't mine, so I come to Red Rock (I've probably been 15 times) for the only organic experience you can get within a 100-mile radius."
r2-0009239,I don't remember what the name was but it was interesting.
r1-0031009,I want to say it's the size of a palm of a hand.
r1-0097121,They asked if I would like to take him to their backyard area and play with him so I took him out there and let him off of his leash.
r1-0032427,I figured it was due to the amount of customers.
r1-0025036,We just moved to Vegas and realized the 24 hr fitness here are always busy and doesn't have many amenities.

r1-0027638,Today was my first day coming to a dentist since moving to the valley 2.5 years ago.

r1-0013064,I got the chicken enchiladas plate with cilantro lime rice & black beans; my boyfriend got the shrimp enchilada and shredded beef taco combo plate with the borracho beans & latin fried potatoes.
r2-0003195,The bride was hard on me.
r1-0006883,Don't be fooled - here's indoor seating!
r1-0100384,"I went about two hours before closing and they only really had jerk and bbq chicken left (which btw, were pretty small pieces)."

r1-0045941,I just had that feeling like a total makeover.
r1-0061580,This sounds healthy right?
r1-0078768,Which we understand if you can't do something but he offered no explanation or help whatsoever.

r1-0008221,"It's kinda uncomfortable sitting at the bar to eat your food the way the bar is designed, so your food isn't in a great position for you to eat so you might wanna sit at a table instead."
r1-0053843,"I went in to buy a gift for my mom for her birthday and the lady didn't have the item in the store, so she ordered it from another store and had it delivered as a gift to my mom's house."

r1-0087206,It's what I expected and the delivery guy was polite.
r1-0079357,My family & I were going on a Sunday.
r1-0071175,"In fact , you owe him !"

r1-0090054,Though a few nurses are very sweet.
r1-0096895,So i get there and head directly to the moshi stand.
r1-0055595,Loud enough atmosphere wise but not because they're blasting music out the speakers.

r2-0011670,We had a nice time dining in the casino we stayed at.
r1-0070102,"But I do believe that the meats used in this place are 'halal' meats, so I doubt this allows for fresh ground beef made into handmade patties."
r1-0071444,First and last trip.
r1-0016913,Service was GREAT!!!
r1-0094432,Order was to be ready at at 4pm.
r1-0093195,My husband and I arrived here at 1 pm on a Sunday.
r1-0031681,I went to Platinum Entourage in hopes that they could fix the horrific highlights and cut that Color salon at Cesar's palace had gave me.

r1-0029845,"I visited on a Saturday evening, with a party of 4."
r1-0047669,"However, after the 30 minutes was up a new passenger was coming aboard and the driver has her take the open seat!"
r1-0026375,"My washing machine was not draining, flooding, and we smelled something burning when we opened the door."
r2-0001702,"We were hoping to go to the one in Brossard, but we just couldn't find it."
r1-0022819,She was most excited for the singing part!
r2-0012424,In my hour of so there 4 different tables walked out with happy faces despite the wait time.
r1-0032760,I would try different roll next time.
r1-0033610,Just saying.
r1-0046281,I ordered their version of a cold brew - they pour a certain amount in a cup and then cut it with water.
r1-0062575,My fiancé and I arrived late last night.
r2-0000128,Fake celeb.
r1-0097257,"To boot, gratuity was automatically included at 15% so we couldn't leave a smaller tip."

r1-0053767,We were offered the kitchen side table which we didn't know anything about.
r1-0039720,But after sitting down our food was out in 5 minutes!
r2-0017339,My orders have been consistent and what you'd expect from any other Chipotle. It was delicious.
r1-0100966,My boyfriend and I took the survey after a visit and were dissatisfied.
r1-0072081,Our water ran low and 2 seconds later we had a whole new ice cold jug set down on the table.
r1-0075990,He told what he would do and about how long he thought it would take.
r1-0062738,"""Legitimate"" sake bar."
r1-0080960,I forgot to mention in my last review of Disgraceland that the bathrooms are not accessible and the bathrooms are gendered.
r1-0060846,"bought some pants, called them up, wanted to know if they have same day service."
r1-0021261,And it is popping almost everyday.
r1-0012670,Let's start with the pasty that one of the diners had.
r2-0008276,"They don't add too much breading, which makes it more authentic. It is so good."
r1-0078418,You can even see them cleaning the wine glasses until there was not a single speck of anything other than glass.
r1-0057159,"Especially where some of those reviewers will say basically that the food was so-so, the service wasn't good and the place wasn't clean -- then they leave a 4-star rating??!!"
r1-0091181,"The last item was an apple, a Reece's Pieces Apple!"
r1-0066654,Our daughter just had a tooth pulled out and 3 cavity fillings done recently and require soft food so we brought a small bowl of home cooked porridge with chopped veggies in case she wasn't able to eat what they had at this restaurant.

r1-0006194,Love Dr.
r1-0061346,We have no experience sitting in the bar.
r1-0041690,-the pull out couch is terrible so dont make anyone sleep on it.
r1-0061662,Nice concept you don't have to eat what some corporate vp decided was good.
r1-0076101,Imho they should have at least 7 or 8 but that's just my two cents.
r1-0057222,"If you are ok not paying for the over styled,  pretentious."

r2-0005681,Also love the ATM deposit function! It rocks.

r1-0064738,She was quick to deliver the check and asked to pack the leftovers while we were still eating.
r1-0094387,I wish I took pictures of the dimsum we ordered to show all yelpers.
r1-0080415,I was hesitant to seek any outside help my entire life and she solidified that for me.
r1-0044744,"= Go straight to the food section, or better yet, just go straight to Añejo."
r1-0001870,Their super model is the lobster pho... Everyone get your cameras out.

r1-0067063,"I'm also annoyed that Octopus has so many people in line there---what a waste of money to go there, when you have such great small businesses like Rocky's to support."
r1-0031589,"To be quite honest, I was a little sketched out by this place."
r1-0012316,I don't consider waiting 150 minutes as receiving Urgent care.
r1-0076084,"It's too crowded, I don't like the other people there, the amenities suck, it smells weird"" and on...and on...and on?"

r1-0083661,Even the prices are pretty good.
r2-0004893,"Also, the screens were all over the store, and some menu items showed in some places and not others. It was bad."
r1-0022041,But remember we had two young girls with us.
